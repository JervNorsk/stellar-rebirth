## Stellar Rebirth

This project was born with the aim of starting our journey in the world of game development.

We thought we'd create a challenge, streamed entirely on Twitch as we develop and explore a possible approach to the
game development pipelines.

Development:

- [Project Board](https://trello.com/b/gOR9SIrg/stellar-rebirth)

Platforms:

- [Itch](https://jervnorsk.itch.io/stellar-rebirth)

  At the moment we are planning to release the game only on Itch, runnable in browser and with PWA technology support.

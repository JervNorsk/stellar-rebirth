## New Direction

We announce that the development of the project towards the new direction has begun!

### Updates

- The Itch.io page as well as the GitHub page have been updated with the new information.

- The prototype source code was put aside and we started from scratch.

- We have updated the graphics engine while still remaining on Unity as in the prototype phase, moving from version 2019.4 to 2022.3.

- We decided to stick to the initial idea of the prototype and develop the game for Android.

  With this objective we first implemented the integration with Google Play and prepared the store page.

  NB: 
  - The Google Play store page is currently undergoing internal testing and cannot be accessed without authorization,
    however testable releases will be available on Itch.io. 

    
### Future Updates

- We expect a further upgrade of the Unity version upon the LTS release of version 2023.3.
- We would also like to produce a WebGL version to integrate mainly on Itch.io.

Hi guys, we can consider the challenge failed.

To briefly explain what happened: there were external commitments that caused an interruption of the stream stream on Twitch and consequently also the freezing of this project.

But let's not lose sight of the goal, the first steps have been taken and we are happy about it.

We therefore announce the resumption of work on Stellar Rebirth.
We've also thought about some evolutions to the gameplay, design and artwork.
In fact, I've recently started preparing some concepts for the game that will also reserve other surprises with some of my future works.

Today I migrated the project to a new pipeline, more standardized and above all connected to some libraries that I am developing between more personal and non-personal projects.

However, the currently released build has been shelved following a major update to the graphics engine.
The development of the game will start from scratch, with the aim of producing mainly an Android version and then thinking about an adaptation of the interface for the WebGL version.
This choice is due to the idea of experimenting with publishing an app on Google Play.
However, I reserve the right to create the build for Android starting from a PWA. It's a test I have to take shortly.
If this is successful, the production of a build for WebGL may return to priority number one.

Thank you for your time.
